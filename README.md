## Arduino library for Flash & FRAM Memory Chips (SPI based only)
<sup> Download the latest stable release from [here](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIMemory/releases/latest). Please report any bugs in [issues](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIMemory/issues/new).</sup>

This Arduino library is for use with flash and FRAM memory chips that communicate using the SPI protocol. In its current form it supports identifying the flash/FRAM chip and its various features; automatic address allocation and management; writing and reading a number of different types of data, ranging from 8-bit to 32-bit (signed and unsigned) values, floats, Strings, arrays of bytes/chars and structs to and from various locations; sector, block and chip erase; and powering down for low power operation.

### Installation

#### Option 1
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage libraries.
- Search for SPIMemory.
- Install the latest version.

#### Option 2
- Click on the 'Clone or download' button above the list of files on this <a href = "https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIMemory/tree/master"> page </a>.
- Select Download ZIP. A .zip file will download to your computer.
- Unzip the archive and rename resulting folder to 'SPIMemory'
- Move the folder to your libraries folder (~/sketches/libraries)

### Usage

#### SPIFlash

- The library is called by declaring the```SPIFlash flash(csPin*)``` constructor where 'flash' can be replaced by a user constructor of choice and 'csPin' is the Chip Select pin for the flash module.

    <sub>* Optional. Do not include csPin if using the default slave select pin for your board.</sub>
- Every version of the library >= v3.0.0 supports the ability to use any of multiple SPI interfaces (if your micro-controller supports them). Switching to use another SPI interface is done by calling ```SPIFlash flash(csPin, &SPI1);``` (or &SPI2 and so on), instead of ```SPIFlash flash(csPin)```.

    <sub>* NOTE: This is currently only supported on the SAMD and STM32 architectures.</sub>
- An alternate version ```SPIFlash flash (SPIPinsArray)``` of the constructor can be used (only with ESP32 board as of now) to enable the use of custom SPI pins. ```SPIPinsArray``` has to be a 4 element array containing the custom SPI pin numbers (as signed integers - int8_t) in the following order - sck, miso, mosi, ss.
- Also make sure to include ```flash.begin(CHIPSIZE*)``` in ```void setup()```. This enables the library to detect the type of flash chip installed and load the right parameters.

    <sub>* Optional</sub>

##### Note on SFDP discovery
As of v3.2.1, SFDP parameter discovery is an user controlled option. To get the library to work with SFDP compatible flash memory chips that are not officially supported by the library, the user must uncomment '//#define USES_SFDP' in 'SPIMemory.h'.

##### Notes on Address overflow and Error checking
- The library has Address overflow enabled by default - i.e. if the last address read/written from/to,  in any function, is 0xFFFFF then, the next address read/written from/to is 0x00000. This can be disabled by uncommenting ```#define DISABLEOVERFLOW``` in SPIMemory.h. (Address overflow only works for Read / Write functions. Erase functions erase only a set number of blocks/sectors irrespective of overflow.)


- All write functions have Error checking turned on by default - i.e. every byte written to the flash memory will be checked against the data stored on the Arduino. Users who require greater write speeds can disable this function by setting an optional last 'errorCheck' argument in any write function to NOERRCHK - For eg. call the function ```writeByte(address, *data_buffer, NOERRCHK)``` instead of ```writeByte(address, *data_buffer)```.

#### SPIFram <sup>^</sup>

- The library is called by declaring the```SPIFram fram(csPin*)``` constructor where 'fram' can be replaced by a user constructor of choice and 'csPin' is the Chip Select pin for the fram module.

    <sub>* Optional. Do not include csPin if using the default slave select pin for your board.</sub>
- Every version of the library >= v3.0.0 supports the ability to use any of multiple SPI interfaces (if your micro-controller supports them). Switching to use another SPI interface is done by calling ```SPIFram fram(csPin, &SPI1);``` (or &SPI2 and so on), instead of ```SPIFram fram(csPin)```.

    <sub>* NOTE: This is currently only officially supported on the SAMD and STM32 architectures.</sub>
- Also make sure to include ```fram.begin(CHIPSIZE*)``` in ```void setup()```. This enables the library to detect the type of fram chip installed and load the right parameters.

<sup>^</sup> <sub> Currently in BETA. The methods in SPIFram are not final and subject to change over the next few revisions.</sub>

The library enables the following functions:

###### `begin(_chipsize)`

###### `setClock(clockSpeed)`

###### `error(_verbosity)`

###### `getManID()`

###### `getJEDECID()`

###### `getUniqueID()`

##### Read commands
<hr>
<sub>
All read commands take a last boolean argument 'fastRead'. This argument defaults to FALSE, but when set to TRUE carries out the Fast Read instruction so data can be read at up to the memory's maximum frequency.
</sub>

<sub>
All read commands only take a 32-bit address variable instead of the optional 16-bit page number & 8-bit offset variables in previous versions of the library (< v3.0.0)
</sub>

###### `readAnything(address, value)`

###### `readByte(address)`

###### `readChar(address)`

###### `readWord(address)`

###### `readShort(address)`

###### `readULong(address)`

###### `readFloat(address)`

###### `readStr(address, outputStr)`

###### `readAnything(address, value)`
<hr>

##### Write commands
<hr>
<sub>
All write commands take a boolean last argument 'errorCheck'. This argument defaults to TRUE, but when set to FALSE will more than double the writing speed. This however comes at the cost of checking for writing errors. Use with care.
