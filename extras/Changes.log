Bugs Squashed:
--> ATTiny85 support available again.

Deletions:
-->

New Boards supported:
--> Arduino Zero now fully supported.

Enhancements:
--> Compatible with the ESP32 core for Arduino as of the current commit <a href = "https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/9618eec19ea470bb59b9a25ebeb8c0c516ca89cc">9618eec</a> on 02.08.2017. For some unknown reason, SPI clock speeds higher than board speed/4 are not stable and so, the clock speed for ESP32 dev boards has currently been throttled to 20MHz.
NOTE: ESP32 boards usually have an SPIFlash already attached to their SS pin, so the user has to declare the ChipSelect pin being used when the constructor is declared - for example
```
SPIFlash flash(33);
```

Bugs Squashed:
--> Fixed issue with reading status register 2 and the Suspend operation where the library was not checking the suspend status correctly.

Deletions:
--> flash.getChipName() has been removed as it is superfluous now that the library is now on its way to multi-chip compatibility.
--> Library is not compatible with the ATTiny85 anymore. Currently working on a fix which will hopefully be rolled out in v2.7.0

New Boards supported:
--> RTL8195A compatibility tested and enabled by @boseji <salearj@hotmail.com> on 02.03.17. Code modified to fit with the library structure by Prajwal Bhattaram on 14.04.17.
--> Compatible with the ESP32 core for Arduino as of the current commit <a href = "https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/7d0968c10dc540709d69a28eab2457075c1e4fa8">7d0968c</a> on 16.04.2017. The ESP32 core currently does not support analogRead and so randomSeed(AnalogRead(A0)) cannot be used. Also, for some unknown reason, SPI clock speeds higher than board speed/4 are not stable and so, the clock speed for ESP32 dev boards has currently been throttled to 20MHz.
--> Added support for the Simblee module.

Enhancements:
--> flash.error() now takes an optional argument 'VERBOSE'. By default the verbosity argument  is set to 'false' and calling flash.error() still returns the latest error code as an unsigned byte. However, running flash.error(VERBOSE) will not only return the latest error code, but will also print it to serial. This - especially in boards with resources to spare - will result in a detailed error report printed to serial.
--> flash.begin() now returns a boolean value to indicate establishment of successful comms with the flash chip. Usercode can be made more efficient now by calling ```if (!flash.begin()) { Serial.println(flash.error(VERBOSE)); }``` to identify a problem as soon as the library code is run.
--> The internal _addressCheck() function now locks up usercode with appropriate error codes if
				a) flash.begin() has not been called (or)
				b) There is a possible issue with the wiring - i.e. the flash chip is non-responsive (or)
				c) If the chip's capacity either cannot be identified & the user has not defined a chipSize in flash.begin().
--> Fixed powerDown() to be more efficient. The chip now powers down much faster than before.
--> Added a new error code. Library can now detect non-responsive chips - bad wiring or otherwise.
--> Streamlined variables to make code structure better.
--> Changed library structure to enable the addition of multi-flash compatibility in the near future.
--> moved `#define RUNDIAGNOSTIC` & `#define HIGHSPEED` to SPIFlash.h from SPIFlash.cpp.
--> Now works with other Winbond modules (not in the official supported module list) (beta) by taking the flash memory size in bits as an argument in flash.begin(_chipSize);
--> Formatted code to be better human readable.
--> Changed the internal _troubleshoot() function to use fewer resources.

//					  						13.11.2016											   //
//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~//
Bugs Squashed:
--> Errorchecking on writeByteArray() and writeCharArray() was broken in 2.4.0 and is fixed now.
--> Previous versions (< 2.5.0) suffered from the inability to write datasets that spanned page boundaries. This has now been fixed (Ref. Enhancements section below)

Deletions:
--> flash.writePage() & flash.readPage() have been retired as they can be duplicated - more effectively - by other functions. Refer to pageDiag() in Diagnostics.ino to see how the same results can be obtained by using flash.writeByteArray() & flash.readByteArray().

Enhancements:
--> Added support for SPI Transactions.
--> Added an upgrade for Arduino Due users to read and write large arrays of data at very high speeds - previously reading 60kb of data would take ~108ms - it now takes ~525uS. In this mode, the time between consecutive reads has been reduced to <12ms (needs more work!).
--> Completely re-written writeByteArray() and writeCharArray() functions. They no longer breakdown when writing arrays that span multiple pages.
--> All functions that write more than 1 byte of data now take into account page boundaries when writing across pages. In previous versions writing across a page boundary would cause the remainder of the data to wrap around to the beginning of the page. Now the data is written seamlessly from one page over to the next.
--> Calling flash.begin() now instantiates the SPI bus. Comms with other SPI slaves do not need to call SPI.begin() if flash.begin() has already been called first in the user's code.
--> Sped up _beginSPI(). Code in _beginSPI() instantiates the SPI bus if another SPI comms library has shut it down.
--> Added function allowing setting SPI clock speeds - call the function ```flash.setClock(uint32_t clockSpeed);``` straight after ```begin();```.
--> Made _beginSPI() & _nextByte() shorter and faster.
--> Replaced all calls to SPI.transfer() with xfer() to make the code more human readable and to enable simplicity when switching platforms.
--> Added the ability to change Chip Erase wait times depending on the chip (supported chips only).
--> Don't need to ```#include <SPI.h>``` in user code anymore. Just ```#include<SPIFlash.h>``` will do. Examples are now updated.
--> Now supports & uses SPI.transfer(*buf, count) along with the standard SPI.transfer(), speeding up the read/write of anything larger than an byte (AVR Boards only)
--> Reduces the program storage space in the uC's flash (AVR Boards)

To-do
--> Need to find a way to better identify _notPrevWritten();
--> Need to fix up eraseBlock32K, eraseBlock64K and eraseSector times

//				 	 						Version 2.4.0 									   	   //
//									Author: Prajwal Bhattaram									   //
//					  						11.09.2016											   //
//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~//
Bugs Squashed:
--> Fixed bug preventing writing to Address 0x00
--> Fixed bug in _notPrevWritten() which did did not perform a thorough enough check to see if a location had been previously written to.
--> Fixed errorchecking bug - it now works for all data types - not just byte/char as previously.
Enhancements & Optimizations:
--> Added a function 'error()' to enable users to check for errors generated at any point in their program.
--> Optimized writePage() so it doesn't depend on other functions and so runs faster than before.
--> Diagnostics.ino now outputs time taken for each function as a part of its and provides additional diagnostic data.
--> Now have a common set of private functions - _prep(), _beginSPI(), _nextByte() & _endSPI() - to replace _prepWrite(), _prepRead(), _beginRead(), _readNextByte(), _beginWrite(), _writeNextByte() & _endProcess();
--> Changed the way _addressCheck() works. It now checks all addresses involved in writing the data rather than one address block at a time and returns the correct address to write to in case overflow is enabled. Also, this function is now built into _prep().
--> Reading and writing using page numbers + offset has been optimised to be faster than before.
--> Optimized the way address and error checking is done so its more efficient and uses few system resources and runs faster.
--> Using this library with an ESP8266 board defaults to using GPIO15 as the Slave Select - unless something different is explicitly specified in the constructor.

	They can be used by uncommenting them in the SPIFlash.cpp file. However, be warned, this particular block of code has only
	been tested with the Arduino	IDE (1.6.5) and only with 8-bit AVR based Arduino boards and will not be supported any further.
